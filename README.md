**Project- 1: Sales Data Analysis**
           - Purpose: Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.
           - Description: In this project, we will dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. We will explore sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and create visualizations using EXCEL,Power BI DAX functions to present our findings effectively. This project showcases our ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

**Project- 2: Diabetics Prediction**
          This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent(several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).
          The task is to find out the patients who has diabetis or not.In this project we use Python and libraries such as Pandas,NumPy,Matplotlib and Seaborn to classify the persons as well as to create some visualisations.
